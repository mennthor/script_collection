# script_collection

Collection of python scripts.

Install using `pip install -e .`.

Entrypoints defined in `setup.py` are available if the Python package binary folder is on the path (check `python -m site` where it is).

In the `examples` folder there are some very non-exhaustive examples...

There should be unit tests for some of the stuff in here, but there isn't...
